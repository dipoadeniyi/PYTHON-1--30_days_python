    "### Mini Project: **Password Strength Checker**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**:  \n",
    "Create a program that takes a user's input for a password and checks its strength based on the following criteria:\n",
    "- At least 8 characters long.\n",
    "- Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n",
    "- Includes at least one numeric digit.\n",
    "- Contains at least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. Take the password as input from the user.\n",
    "2. Use string methods like `.lower()`, `.isupper()`, `.isdigit()`, and slicing to validate the password.\n",
    "3. Print whether the password is weak, medium, or strong based on how many criteria it satisfies."
